10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
temp = dict()
temp1 = list()
for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith("From") and not line.startswith("From:"):
        line = line.split()
        line = line[5].split(":")
        line = line[0]
        temp[line] = temp.get(line,0) + 1
temp1 = temp.items()
temp1 = sorted(temp1)
for k,v in temp1:
    print k,v
